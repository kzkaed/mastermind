  if there are duplicate colours in the guess, they cannot all be awarded a key peg unless they correspond to the same
number of duplicate colours in the hidden code. For example, if the hidden code is white-white-black-black and the
player guesses white-white-white-black, the codemaker will award two colored key pegs for the two correct whites,
nothing for the third white as there is not a third white in the code, and a colored key peg for the black. No
indication is given of the fact that the code also includes a second black.[5]
