Gameplay and rules
The game is played using:

ruby bin/run.rb      human player
ruby bin/run.rb C    computer player

A secret code is generated
Try to guess the code of 4 colors (color pegs) from RED YELLOW BLUE GREEN BLACK WHITE
A key peg response will be returned
BLACK indicates that one color peg was the correct color in the correct position
WHITE indicates that one color peg was the correct color but NOT correct position
o indicates no match in color or position

If the secret code is: Red Yellow Blue Green
A guess will look like: Red Red Yellow Yellow
A response will look like: o o Black White

The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within MAX turns. Each
guess is made by typing into console. Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by
placing from zero to four key pegs. A black key peg is place for each code peg from the guess which is correct
in both color and position. A white key peg indicates the existence
 of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position.[4]

If there are duplicate colors in the guess, they cannot all be awarded a key peg unless they correspond to the same
number of duplicate colors in the hidden code. For example, if the hidden code is red-red-blue-blue and the
player guesses red-red-red-blue, the codemaker will award two "black" key pegs for the two correct reds,
nothing for the third red as there is not a third red in the code, and a "black" key peg for the blue.
No indication is given of the fact that the code also includes a second blue.[5]

Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the
codebreaker guesses correctly, or MAX incorrect guesses are made.
